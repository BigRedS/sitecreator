# Some environment variables. 'keys' are uppercased
# before setting, and may be set in any order. These
# each have defaults, which are reset here:
env:
 # Where to look for scripts, this one is required:
 scripts_dir: /var/lib/sitecreator/scripts/
 # Where to look for diretories; this one is required by 
 # the apache script
 templates_dir: /var/lib/sitecreator/templates
 # Where to write Apache Vhosts. This, too, is required by
 # the apache vhost script:
 vhost_dir: /etc/apache2/sites-available
 # Where to write logs:
 log_dir: /var/log/sitecreator

# The 'users' block defines users that will need to be created. In the 
# next block ('scripts'), you pass these details to the scripts that do
# the actual user creation and password setting. You reference these there 
# by the name given to them here, and these stanzas define their properties:
users:
 # For example, here we simply state that the unix user reqiures a password
 # of nine characters. We will later pass this to the 'create_unix_user.sh' 
 # script by calling it %PASSWORD_unix%
 # When sitecreator exits it prints a list of the user accounts it created 
 # and their passwords, the 'order' key is used to specify the order in which
 # these should be output (smaller numbers first), and the 'label' key is used
 # to set what is printed to screen as the name of this. If 'label' is undefined
 # then the name of the block is used 'unix' here, and if the order key is
 # undefined then so to is the order in which the users are printed.
 # 'length' and 'complexity' refer to the generated password - length is a simple
 # character count, and complexity refers to the included characters - default is
 # zero which is alphanumeric, 1, 2 and 3 each add further (printable) characters.
 unix:
  label: FTP/SSH
  length: 9
  complexity: 3
  order: 1

# And here we create two MySQL users, one called 'mysql' and the other 
# 'mysqldev'. The MySQL user simply needs a password distinct from the 
# unix one, but can have the same username. This is then called 
# %PASSWORD_mysql% when it is passed to create_mysql.sh:
# 'mysqldev', however, also requires a new username. This username is
# created with the 'username' key', which uses the same placeholders as
# does the scripts block below.
# Incidentally, the create_mysql.sh script creates a database for each user, 
# but that's not defined here.
 mysql:
  label: MySQL
  length: 12
  complexity: 0
  order: 2
  # Arbitrary data can be included for printing out at the end of the process. 
  # sitecreator has know knowledge of what the scripts it is executing are 
  # doing, so if they do anything other than simply create a user with a 
  # username and password you can use these labels to get details on those things
  # included in the output. They must start with an underscore, and the label end
  # with 'label' and the value with 'value'. Both are interpolated for placeholders
  # as per the arguments to scripts.

scripts:
# Scripts to run, in the order in which they should be run. There
# are some placeholders to use to have arguments sent to the scripts:
#	%DOMAIN%          The domain passed on the command-line
#	%DOMAINS%         a space-separated list of domains, including aliases
#                         the first member of the list is the domain passed as
#                         the argument, followed by those specified by -a
#	%USERNAME%        username
#	%TEMPLATES_DIR%   templates directory
#	%PASSWORD_<name>% Generated password. This password will only be generated
#                         if it is listed in 'passwords' above
#	%USERNAME_<name>% %USERNAME%, but with the username_suffix in the named
#                         user appended to it.
#
# Here, for example, we create a Unix user by passing the 'create_unix_user.sh' 
# script the username generated from the domain, and the password created to satisfy
# the length demanded in the 'unix' block of 'users':
 - create_unix_user.sh %USERNAME% %PASSWORD_unix%
# You can also reference usernames and passwords defined in 'users' above.
# Here's an example of using a generated password, in this case the mysql one:
 - create_mysql.sh %USERNAME% %PASSWORD_mysql%
# Here, too, we create another MySQL user with another different password, but also
# a different username. In this case, we're creating the 'mysqldev' user, which not
# only requiores its own password, but a username suffix of '_dev':
 - create_mysql.sh %USERNAME_mysqldev% %PASSWORD_mysqldev%
 - create_apache_vhost.pl %USERNAME% %DOMAINS%
 - restart_apache.sh
 - add_ssh_keys.sh %USERNAME% %TEMPLATES_DIR%
# - add_mail_domain.sh %DOMAIN% %PASSWORD_MAIL%
